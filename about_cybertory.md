# Cybertory Virtual Molecular Biology Laboratory

While no longer active, many of the Cybertory web pages are still viewable on the Wayback Machine. The plan was to have an open source version with a simple HTML interface (cybertory.org), and a commercial version with a pictoral interface (in Flash).

## Form interface

* [cybertory.org home page](https://web.archive.org/web/20150814010346/http://www.cybertory.org/)
* Description of the [PCR Simulator](https://web.archive.org/web/20150814010346/http://www.cybertory.org/simulators/pcr/index.html)

## Flash interface

![flash interface](https://github.com/rmhorton/cybertoryTNG/blob/main/flashInterface.png)
* [Cybertory.com homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20080911131451/http://www.cybertory.com/)
* [Reaction setup Flash app](https://web.archive.org/web/20081220111719/http://cybertory.com/cgi-bin/lab.cgi?place=rxnSetup) (this doesn't really work without a server, but it at least loads in the wayback emulator!).
