# User Manual: DNA Melting Curve Simulator with HMM and Derivative Plotting

## Overview

This web-based application simulates the melting behavior of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as a function of temperature. It utilizes a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to estimate the fraction of DNA that has melted at each temperature point. Additionally, the app computes and visualizes the first derivative of the melting curve, providing insights into the rate of melting across the temperature range.

## Computational Methodology

### 1. Thermodynamic Modeling

The melting behavior is modeled using the nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model, which calculates the enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) for each base pair step in the DNA sequence. These parameters are derived from empirical data and describe the energy changes associated with base pair stacking interactions. The melting temperature (Tm) is estimated using the equation:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \cdot \Delta S
$$

where ΔG is the free energy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔH and ΔS are the enthalpy and entropy changes, respectively. The melting probability at each temperature is then computed using the Boltzmann distribution:

$$
P_{\text{melt}} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta G}{RT}\right)}
$$

where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin \[1,2].

### 2. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Base-Resolved DNA Melting

The HMM provides a probabilistic framework for estimating the melting state of each DNA base pair. Each base pair is modeled as a **hidden state**:

* **Unmelted (U)**: Base pair is double-stranded.
* **Melted (M)**: Base pair is single-stranded.

The **observations** are the thermodynamic emission probabilities for each base, computed from nearest-neighbor ΔH and ΔS values.

#### Forward-Backward Algorithm

The **forward-backward algorithm** computes the posterior probability that each base is melted given the sequence:

1. **Forward pass (α)**: Probability of observing the sequence up to base $i$ and ending in state $s$ (U or M).
2. **Backward pass (β)**: Probability of observing the sequence from base $i+1$ to the end given state $s$ at base $i$.
3. **Posterior probability**:

$$
P(M_i \mid \text{sequence}) = \frac{\alpha_i(M) \cdot \beta_i(M)}{\alpha_i(U) \cdot \beta_i(U) + \alpha_i(M) \cdot \beta_i(M)}
$$

This produces a base-by-base **melt map** representing the likelihood of melting at a given temperature.

**Forward-Backward Table Example (3-base DNA, `ATG`)**

| Base | α(U) | α(M) | β(U) | β(M) | Posterior P(M) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------------- |
| A    | 0.40 | 0.10 | 0.35 | 0.50 | 0.12           |
| T    | 0.18 | 0.05 | 0.60 | 0.45 | 0.20           |
| G    | 0.03 | 0.04 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.57           |

This table shows how the forward (α) and backward (β) probabilities combine to produce the posterior probability of each base being melted.

#### Viterbi Algorithm

The **Viterbi algorithm** identifies the **most probable sequence of hidden states** (U or M):

1. **Initialization**: Set starting probabilities using initial state distribution ($\pi$) and emission probabilities.
2. **Recursion**:

$$
V_i(s) = \max_{s'} \big[ V_{i-1}(s') \cdot a_{s's} \big] \cdot e_s(i)
$$

where $a_{s's}$ is the transition probability from state $s'$ to $s$, and $e_s(i)$ is the emission probability.

3. **Traceback**: Reconstruct the most likely state sequence from the last base backward.

**Viterbi Table Example (3-base DNA, `ATG`)**

| Base | U     | M     |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| A    | 0.40  | 0.10  |
| T    | 0.18  | 0.05  |
| G    | 0.032 | 0.036 |

* Traceback: Most likely path → `U M M`
* Interpretation: Base 1 remains unmeltd, Bases 2–3 are melted at this temperature.

### 3. First Derivative Calculation

The first derivative of the melting curve is computed using finite differences:

$$
\frac{dP_{\text{melt}}}{dT} \approx \frac{P_{\text{melt}}(T + \Delta T) - P_{\text{melt}}(T)}{\Delta T}
$$

This highlights the rate of melting, with peaks indicating temperature ranges where the DNA transitions most rapidly from double-stranded to single-stranded form \[2].

## Assumptions and Approximations

* **Constant Ionic Conditions**: Assumes fixed monovalent (Na⁺) and divalent (Mg²⁺) ion concentrations \[2].
* **Ideal Solution Behavior**: Neglects DNA–DNA or DNA–solute interactions.
* **Uniform Sequence Composition**: Does not account for mismatches or secondary structures \[1].

## Novelty of the HMM Approach

The HMM framework introduces a probabilistic, base-resolved model of DNA melting. Unlike traditional methods (Ising models or ensemble averages), it estimates the posterior probability of each base being melted and allows computation of the **most likely melting path** across the DNA sequence \[4–6].

This approach is novel because:

* **Sequential Modeling**: Captures cooperative effects between neighboring bases.
* **Posterior Probabilities**: Generates base-resolved melt maps.
* **Integration with Thermodynamics**: Emission probabilities are derived from nearest-neighbor ΔH/ΔS parameters.
* **Dynamic Temperature Range**: Supports plotting melting curves and derivatives across continuous temperature ranges.
