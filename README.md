# CybertoryTNG

The next generation of the Cybertory virtual molecular biology lab will focus on making the system easier for teachers to deploy and maintain. We're starting with a client-side version of the PCR simulator that will let students design primers to amplify target regions from microbial genomes, or do experiments on more complex templates (like mammalian genomes) using pre-designed primers.

For an historical overview of the original Cybertory project, see the [about page](https://github.com/rmhorton/cybertoryTNG/blob/main/about_cybertory.md).
