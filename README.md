# CybertoryTNG

The next generation of the Cybertory virtual molecular biology lab will focus on making the system easier for teachers to deploy and maintain. We're starting with a client-side version of the PCR simulator that will let students design primers to amplify target regions from microbial genomes

For an historical overview of the original Cybertory project, see the [about page](https://github.com/rmhorton/cybertoryTNG/blob/main/about_cybertory.md).
